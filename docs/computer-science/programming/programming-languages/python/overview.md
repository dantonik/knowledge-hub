Package installation with pip.  
The Python Package Index (PyPI)  

### Where can you run Python code?
- REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)
- file
```
python my_program.py
```
- from another program
```
#!/usr/bin/env python

import my_program

my_program hello()

print(my_program add_two(4))
```

When code is saved to file with the purpose of re use, it is called a module.  
When a module or a group of modules is bundled together specifically for distribution to an installation in multiple python environments it is referred to as a package.
