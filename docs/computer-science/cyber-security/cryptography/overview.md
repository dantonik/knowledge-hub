# Overview

Encryption is a method of scrambling so only keyholders can comprehend the data.  
Plain text -> cypher text   

### Symmetric encryption
The same key is used for encryption and decryption. The key must be exchanged so the recipient can read the plaintext.
It can encrypt large amount of data in little time.  

examples: 3DES, AES, RC6  

### Asymmetric encryption
Two mathematically related keys are being used.  

examples: RSA, DSA, Diffle-Hellman Key Agreement
